# Deployment Checklist - Fix Data Fetching Issues

## Problem
- ✅ Adding schools works in production
- ❌ Viewing schools doesn't work in production (data not displayed)
- ✅ Everything works fine in local development

## Root Cause
The issue is that `getServerSideProps` was trying to call the internal API route `/api/getSchools`, which can fail in production environments on Vercel due to serverless function limitations.

## Solution Applied
1. **Direct Database Query**: Updated `showSchools.jsx` to query the database directly in `getServerSideProps` instead of calling the API route
2. **Client-Side Fallback**: Added a fallback component that can fetch data client-side if server-side fails
3. **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced error logging and debugging information
4. **Connection Pooling**: Improved database connection handling for production

## Files Modified
- `pages/showSchools.jsx` - Direct database query + client-side fallback
- `lib/db.js` - Better connection pooling and error handling
- `pages/api/getSchools.js` - Improved error handling
- `pages/api/testDb.js` - Enhanced diagnostic information
- `next.config.mjs` - Better serverless function handling
- `vercel.json` - Vercel-specific configuration

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Set Environment Variables in Vercel
Go to your Vercel dashboard → Project Settings → Environment Variables and set:

```
DB_HOST=your_production_database_host
DB_USER=your_production_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_production_password
DB_NAME=your_production_database_name
DB_PORT=3306
DB_SSL=true
```

### 2. Redeploy
After setting environment variables, redeploy your application.

### 3. Test
1. Visit `/api/testDb` to verify database connection
2. Visit `/showSchools` to see if data loads
3. Check Vercel function logs for any errors

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Primary Method**: Data loads directly from database in `getServerSideProps`
2. **Fallback Method**: If server-side fails, client-side component fetches from API
3. **Debug Information**: Clear error messages and debugging details
4. **Performance**: Better performance with connection pooling

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Not Working:

1. **Check Vercel Logs**:
   - Go to Vercel dashboard → Functions
   - Look for errors in the logs

2. **Test Database Connection**:
   - Visit `/api/testDb` in your deployed app
   - Check if environment variables are set correctly

3. **Verify Database Access**:
   - Ensure your database allows external connections
   - Check firewall rules
   - Verify SSL configuration

4. **Check Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure all variables are set in Vercel
   - Variable names are case-sensitive
   - Redeploy after setting variables

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
- Vercel function execution times
- Database connection success rates
- Error logs in Vercel dashboard
- User experience on the `/showSchools` page

## Success Indicators

✅ Schools data displays correctly on `/showSchools` page
✅ No errors in Vercel function logs
✅ Database connection test passes at `/api/testDb`
✅ Both adding and viewing schools work in production
